            <p class="m-1">Visit our <a href="/list/">Directory</a> and use the search bar to narrow your search.
            Keywords should be separated by white spaces and can mix words from different fields
            (e.g. 'machine learning London' or 'NLP healthcare'). You can filter
            results to display only profiles from under-represented countries (list based on the
            <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups">World's Bank</a>
            list of Low, Lower-Middle and Upper-Middle income economies as of August 2017).</p>

            <p class="m-1">Look at the profile provided by the researcher and
            search for other profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, institution, ResearchGate, …).
            Important note: the researchers are sole responsible for their profiles and we
            cannot guarantee authenticity.</p>

            <p class="m-1">It is a vicious circle: researchers need to be known to get
            invited as speakers but they need to be invited as speaker to get known. This cycle
            can be broken by taking a chance and inviting someone less recognized. Don't forget that younger scientists
            also have things to say and they might be more approachable/committed.</p>
